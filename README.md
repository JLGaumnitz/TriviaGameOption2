Equine Trivia Game, Option 2
created by Jennifer Gaumnitz

Here's how the quiz works:

* There are 10 horse-related trivia questions, each with 4 multiple choice options to choose from. The questions are displayed one at a time.

* The player has 15 seconds to complete each question. They may only pick one answer per question. A countdown timer is displayed. When the player chooses the correct answer, the next page affirms that they chose correctly and displays a bit more information about the topic of the question. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the screen tells the player they selected the wrong option and displays the correct answer and a bit more information about the topic. If the player did not answer in 15 seconds, the page states that the player ran out of time and displays the correct answer and a bit more information about the topic. In 6 seconds, the screen moves on to the next question, where a new timer and the number of the new question (Question X of 10) are also displayed.

* The game ends when the player finishes answering the last question or time runs out on the last question. The final scoreboard page tallies the number of questions that the player answered correctly and incorrectly or left unanswered. It also gives the player a button to push to play again without refreshing the page.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

  The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with jQuery and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught me how to work with a timer function in JavaScript.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

  Just push the "Giddy-up" button to begin the game. The questions advance automatically, even if the player does not choose an answer.
